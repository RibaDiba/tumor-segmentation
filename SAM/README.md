## Fine Tuning with SAM 

### Use 

In this branch, there are two notebooks.  "tumor_segmentation.ipynb' has what you need to train the dataset. "Visualizing.ipynb" has what you need to visualize the results after training the data. The other files in this folder correspond to different functions to load into the notebook to preprocess the code. 

After you are done training it, visualize the results using "visualizing.ipynb"

To directly visualize the model, just use the model checkpoint found in google drive and run the notebook. Upload into the models folder and set your model path accordingly  

### Where do our models go?

Well since github only allows a maximum of 100mb of data, they are on our shared google drive.
